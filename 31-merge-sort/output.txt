And if we get out, get out
And if we get out, get out
And if we get out, get out
And realize we'd been living as slaves
And signpost the righteous road
And taste the ocean spray
But is it worth the price of our soul?
But is it worth the price of our soul?
But is it worth the price of our soul?
Can now be tamed to go
Gaze at the horizon
How long I haven't seen the light
I'll think about the price of our soul
I'll think about the price of our soul
I'll think about the price of our soul
Lost everything, family, confusion on the way
My animal inside
Oh my dirty hands, It never fades
Oh my dirty hands, it never fades
Oh, my dirty hands, it never fades
Over the wall
Shine through in my life
Someone tries to talk to me
We'll live a life without barricades
We'll live a life without barricades
We've got to learn to get back, get back
We've got to learn to get back, get back
We've got to learn to get back, get back
We've got to learn to live free, live free
We've got to learn to live free, live free
We've got to learn to live free, live free
Without living in fear?
Wouldn't be sweet to watch the sun curve down meets the waves?
Wouldn't it be nice to take a walk on some pure white sand
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
