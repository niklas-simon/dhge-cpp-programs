Wouldn't it be nice to take a walk on some pure white sand
Gaze at the horizon
Without living in fear?
Wouldn't be sweet to watch the sun curve down meets the waves?
And taste the ocean spray
And realize we'd been living as slaves
We've got to learn to get back, get back
But is it worth the price of our soul?
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
Oh, my dirty hands, it never fades
And if we get out, get out
I'll think about the price of our soul
We've got to learn to live free, live free
We'll live a life without barricades
How long I haven't seen the light
Shine through in my life
Lost everything, family, confusion on the way
Someone tries to talk to me
And signpost the righteous road
My animal inside
Can now be tamed to go
Over the wall
We've got to learn to get back, get back
But is it worth the price of our soul?
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
Oh my dirty hands, it never fades
And if we get out, get out
I'll think about the price of our soul
We've got to learn to live free, live free
We'll live a life without barricades
We've got to learn to get back, get back
But is it worth the price of our soul?
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
Oh my dirty hands, It never fades
And if we get out, get out
I'll think about the price of our soul
We've got to learn to live free, live free
We'll live a life without barricades
