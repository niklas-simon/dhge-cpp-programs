i don't feel a single thing
have the pills done too much
haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
and now we're outta touch
i've been driving in l.a.
and the world it feels too big
like a floating ball that's bound to break
snap my psyche like a twig
and i just wanna see if you feel the same as me
do you ever get a little bit tired of life
like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
like you're hanging by a thread but you gotta survive
'cause you gotta survive
like your body's in the room but you're not really there
like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
am i past repair
a little bit tired of tryin' to care when i don't
a little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
a little bit tired of sinkin'
there's water in my boat
i'm barely breathin'
tryna stay afloat
so i got these quick repairs to cope
guess i'm just broken and broke
the prescriptions on its way
with a name i can't pronounce
and the dose i gotta take
boy, i wish that i could count
'cause i just wanna see if this could make me happy
do you ever get a little bit tired of life
like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
like you're hanging by a thread but you gotta survive
'cause you gotta survive
like your body's in the room but you're not really there
like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
am i past repair
a little bit tired of tryin' to care when i don't
a little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
a little bit tired of sinking
there's water in my boat
i'm barely breathin'
tryna stay afloat
so i got these quick repairs to cope
do you ever get a little bit tired of life
like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
like a numb little bug that's gotta survive
that's gotta survive
