Can now be tamed to go
We've got to learn to get back, get back
We'll live a life without barricades
Lost everything, family, confusion on the way
Without living in fear?
But is it worth the price of our soul?
Oh my dirty hands, it never fades
We've got to learn to get back, get back
We've got to learn to live free, live free
Wouldn't it be nice to take a walk on some pure white sand
Oh my dirty hands, It never fades
And if we get out, get out
My animal inside
But is it worth the price of our soul?
I'll think about the price of our soul
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
And taste the ocean spray
How long I haven't seen the light
Gaze at the horizon
I'll think about the price of our soul
Shine through in my life
Someone tries to talk to me
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
We've got to learn to live free, live free
Wouldn't be sweet to watch the sun curve down meets the waves?
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
And realize we'd been living as slaves
We've got to learn to get back, get back
And if we get out, get out
And signpost the righteous road
Oh, my dirty hands, it never fades
I'll think about the price of our soul
And if we get out, get out
We'll live a life without barricades
We've got to learn to live free, live free
But is it worth the price of our soul?
Over the wall
