I'm alone here on my island, floating in the sky
I'm high above the world I used to know
And I'm far from any danger, safe from any failure
Guarded, I found shelter in the storm
I'm hiding in the blue
Safe between the clouds
In the blue
Where I can't be found
Was a soldier in the legions, fought against the demons
Fought against the monsters made of gold
But they stormed across Arcadia, following their nature
Washed away the place I once called home
I'm hiding in the blue
Safe between the clouds
In the blue
Where I can't be found
I'm hiding in the blue
I'm hiding in the blue
As time goes racing by, I'm wishing I could be fine
But I'm still so stuck on what used to be
Made a prison out of my mind, watch life as it goes by
Battle-scarred, my own worst enemy
I'm hiding in the blue
Safe between the clouds
In the blue
Where I can't be found
I'm hiding in the blue
I'm hiding in the blue
Hiding in the blue
The world's passing by, and I lost sense of time
I've gone numb, I miss the days when we were making legends
The days come and go, I'll wait through sun and snow
For you to come and take me from this place and bring me home
In the blue
Safe between the clouds
In the blue
Where I can't be found
I'm hiding in the blue
Hiding in the blue
In the blue
